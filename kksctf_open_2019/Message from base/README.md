## Challenge

We captured some weird messages from kackers group bots. We are not 100% sure this is encrypted, but we still can't read or decode the message. Help us!

## Solution

Task name hints us to do something with base. Looking at characters, it may be in a numeral system with base 22 or higher. Let's try 22!
It converts to number `208680969563662669880355405571581710048531200248533882328034699304208685490174848941949` in decimal numeral system. Than we can transform if to bytes, decode and get
