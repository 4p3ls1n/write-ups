## Solution

Only numbers are given which look like modulus ans chipertexts.

Firstly, we tried find N in factordb (http://www.factordb.com/)
(I have no information for any attack I know, so I started with factoring)

Fortunately, there is factoring in the db.
So we can calulate phi(n) = (p-1)(q-1)

After we need to find private exponent. Because there is no information about public, we can just guess it (or use brute-force attack)

One of possible ways you can find in solver.py
(brute-force e until we get readable text)
